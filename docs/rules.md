# BQBL Rules

These rules are an adaptation of
[the original Grantland rules](http://grantland.com/the-triangle/introducing-grantlands-bad-quarterback-league/)
from 2011.

Rule changes for 2016:

* Limit ABQBL DH usages to 6 times per season
* Sacks worth 1 point each
* Extend Special Tebow rules to apply to Manziel as well
* Trump-related 24/7 points

## General rules

Before the season, each person drafts 4 teams.

Each week during the season (NFL weeks 1-16), you choose 2 of the 32 NFL teams
to play.

Over the course of the season:

* under NBQBL rules:

    * You must pick each team you drafted at least 5 times and at most 13 times
      each.

    * You may not pick teams you didn't draft.

* under ABQBL rules:

    * You must pick each team you drafted at least 4 times each.

    * You may pick each other team at most 1 time each, and you may pick a team
      you didn't draft at most 6 times during the season. ("Designated Shitter"
      rule)

The deadline for picks each week is **Sunday at 1pm Eastern**, i.e., the start
of the "early game" block. If you don't enter picks by then, random picks will
be made for you.

For teams that play before the deadline (e.g., Thursday night games, Sunday
London games), the team is "locked" at the time the game starts. If you have
entered a pick for team when the game starts, it's locked in and you can't
change it. If you haven't, then you can't use that team that week.

You score on-field points for the teams that you picked each week. Points are
scored for aggregate QB performance, e.g., if your team uses two QBs who have 2
turnovers and 175 yards each, you get the 4-turnover bonus and the 350-yard
penalty. Pass attempts by non-QBs don't count; if a WR serves up an easy
interception on an ill-conceived trick play, you don't get any points.

You score 24/7 points for all of your drafted teams, regardless of which teams
you picked. All QBs on the roster count, so if the third-string QB tweets out a
dick pic, you still cash in even if that QB has never set foot on the field.

Highest total score after Week 16 wins. Week 17 is the BQBL Pro Bowl, which is a
separate competition.

      head

* Benched during game (for non-injury reasons): **35 points**

      football. The guideline we use is that it's necessary (but not sufficient)
      to have a passer rating below 67.0, *or* at least 2 turnovers.

      is generally agreed to have played poorly, and is replaced without having

    * Each subsequent vote of confidence in the same QB is worth 5 points more
      than the last

    * Points are doubled for votes of confidence in a different QB

    * Generally: Nth vote of confidence for Kth distinct QB: K × (5 + 5N) points

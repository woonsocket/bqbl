Features:
- Add a running total to the scoreboard
- Clicking on a line-score item should pop up a card explaining the score

Cleanup:
- MDL-ize the scary stuff (app, nflscores)
- Inject a router module extension (terminology?) that reads week and year from the url
- Inject a module that redirects to login when you're not logged in
- Move ALL_WEEKS into the db, start having things deal with it sensibly
- Move ad-hoc schema (leagues, scores?) into explicit TypeScript classes
- ADD TESTS
- Use input binding to ensure consistent weeks, inject years? 
- EventEmitter to decide when to hide week selector


If there's time:
- Check for <5 teams played. Lower priority because we can just force it the last five weeks of the year.
- Preserve week selection as you move between pages
- Add year as a URL parameter where it makes sense

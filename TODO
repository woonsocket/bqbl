Features:
P0 Move all of the fancy new stuff from the /tmp path
- Add safety support to the console
- Add a running total to the scoreboard
- Add a whole-year per-team "Stats" view
- Add a whole-year per-user "Standings" view
- Lock down when teams can be selected
- Pre-populate new users with legal team selections
- Make the scoreboard per-league

Cleanup:
- MDL-ize the scary stuff (app, nflscores)
- Inject a "default week" component, automatically advance it
- Inject a router module extension (terminology?) that reads week and year from the url
- Inject a module that redirects to login when you're not logged in
- Move ALL_WEEKS into the db, start having things deal with it sensibly
- Move more ad-hoc schema into explicit TypeScript classes
- ADD TESTS

If there's time:
- Check for <5 teams played. Lower priority because we can just force it the last five weeks of the year.
- Preserve week selection as you move between pages
- Add year as a URL parameter where it makes sense

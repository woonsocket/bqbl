P0 Finish league support 
P0 Move all of the fancy new stuff from the /tmp path
P1 Add year as a URL parameter where it makes sense
- Add safety support to the console
- Add a running total to the scoreboard
- Add a whole-year per-team stats view
- Add a whole-year per-user stats view
- Lock down when teams can be selected
- Pre-populate new users with legal team selections

Leagues:
- Allow new users to select their league
- Allow users to "claim" their team once they select a league
- Disable DH-ing for leagues that disallow it

- Inject a "default week" component, automatically advance it
- Inject a router module extension (terminology?) that reads week and year from the url
- Inject a module that redirects to login when you're not logged in
- Move ALL_WEEKS into the db, start having things deal with it sensibly
- Move more ad-hoc schema into explicit TypeScript classes
- ADD TESTS

If there's time:
- Check for <5 teams played. Lower priority because we can just force it the last five weeks of the year.
- Preserve week selection as you move between pages
